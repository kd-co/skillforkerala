				<h4 class="brand-header-sm">What is Skill for Kerala?</h4>
				<p class="section-desc-md">Skill for Kerala is a Kerala Designers Collaborative initiative where artists, designers and like can donate their skill towards the rebuilding of Kerala. Any sellable skill can be pledged, and customers can render the services in exchange for a donation to <a href="https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in" class="normal-link" target="_blank">Kerala CMDRF - Chief Minister's Distress Relief Fund</a>.</p>

				<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Why Skill for Kerala?</h4>
				<p class="section-desc-md">For the second consecutive year, unprecedented floods have ravaged the state of Kerala, with damage scaling to several thousands of crores. Relief and rehabilitation measures are immediate need of the hour, while rebuild is a long-term plan. We all are trying to do everything on this regard in our own way.</p>

				<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Why CMDRF?</h4>
				<p class="section-desc-md"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pinkovox/photos/a.241259059715089/707265126447811/" target="_blank" class="normal-link">Read this</a>.</p>

				<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Why, this is a cool idea!</h4>
				<p class="section-desc-md">WHY YOU NO SHARE YET THEN?</p>

						<li role="presentation" class="active"><a href="#faq-artists" aria-controls="faq-artists" role="tab" data-toggle="tab">For Artists</a></li>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">How does this work?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">It's quite simple. List your skills along with an amount of time you can spare, and an hourly rate for your skill by filling in <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfNW4aawqvaN9Zc3kDs070flNuJEjV_So930p9WGfcgoVFgg/viewform" target="_blank" class="normal-link">this form</a>. Once your entry is verified, it will appear for everyone to see. A client who wants to use your skill would contact you. Once you and your client agrees, the client will donate the service fee to CMDRF and send you the receipt, and you deliver the work.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Who can pledge?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">If you have a skill, and time to spare, do pledge.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">What skills can be pledged?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">Any sellable skills can be pledged. Freehand drawing, painting, illustration, graphic design, web development, UI/UX, 3D, marketing/branding, consultation, photography, video editing, content writing, training, workshops, music... literally anything!</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">You haven't listed my skill above! 😠</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">Ah, a classic case of oversight. Don't let that stop you from pledging.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">How do I calculate my hourly rate?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">You can look at existing pledges to get a general idea. But having said that, you are the best judge of your work, so please price your work accordingly. Also, the price listed is for a general idea. You can fix the exact amount for a project depending on the requirement and work specifications.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">What is a portfolio?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">A portfolio is a web reference which lists your work. It can be your personal website or blog or portfolio profiles (behance etc), or social media page (facebook, instagram, linkedin, pinterest, youtube etc)</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">I don't have a portfolio!</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">It might be a good idea to start one. There are several resources online which helps to start a portfolio page. Meanwhile, you could link to something that showcase your work, like a facebook album or an instagram page. This helps the client in their decision.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Someone has contacted me, what all do I need to take care of?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">Make sure you come to an agreement on your price, commitment and timelines with your client. Have the final agreement sign-off in writing. Ask the client to do the donation and send you the details of the donation. Please start the project only AFTER you have a confirmation of the donation.</p>
							<p class="section-desc-md">Once you taken up a project, <a href="mailto:keraladesignerscollaborative@gmail.com" class="normal-link">let us know</a>, so that we can update the projects page.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Can I sell my finished product here, like a painting I have already done?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">We recommend offering your services based on client inputs, rather than finished products.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Can the clients donate to another charity/NGO instead of CMDRF?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">We recommend routing all the donations to CMDRF. If your client is skeptical about the transparency of CMDRF, ask them to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pinkovox/photos/a.241259059715089/707265126447811/" class="normal-link" target="_blank">read this</a>.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Do I have to pay KDCo for my listing? Does KDCo makes anything out of this?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">No and No. Also, please note that KDCo will not be a middleman in any communication and/or dispute between you and your client.</p>

						</div>
						<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane animated fadeIn" id="faq-clients">

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">How does this work?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">It's quite simple. If you have any skill requirements, have a look at the listing. You can use the search or filter to see specific listings. Check the pricing, portfolio, contact the artist. Once you and your artist agrees, donate the service fee to CMDRF and send them the receipt, and they will deliver your work.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">What if I cannot find a skill that I need?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">Use <a class="normal-link" href="">this form</a> to request for a skill. This will let artists contact you.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">There are multiple artists for the same skill. Does KDCo recommend someone?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">Please use your best judgement for selecting artists. Check their portfolio for previous works. Match their price with your budget. Contact the artists and talk to them. KDCo will not recommend one over the other from the listing.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">I have found someone who can do my work. What next?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">Send your complete requirements to the artist. Make sure you come to an agreement on your price, commitment and timelines with the artist. Have the final agreement sign-off in writing. Do the donation and send the details to the artist.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Can I negotiate over the price?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">While a reasonable negotiation can be done, please note the intention of this drive. The service fee in its entirety is going to a fund to rebuild Kerala.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">I have already donated to CMDRF. Can I use my previous donation for this?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">No. We appreciate your contribution. But do a separate one for this. Do not use same contribution for multiple skill requests. Also, please make sure that you donate only AFTER you have a final agreement with your artist.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Can I donate to another charity/NGO instead of CMDRF?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">We recommend routing all the donations to <a href="https://donation.cmdrf.kerala.gov.in" class="normal-link" target="_blank">CMDRF</a>. If you are skeptical about the transparency of CMDRF, please <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pinkovox/photos/a.241259059715089/707265126447811/" class="normal-link" target="_blank">read this</a>.</p>

							<h4 class="brand-header-sm">Do I have to pay anything to KDCo for this? Does KDCo makes anything out of this?</h4>
							<p class="section-desc-md">No and No. Also, please note that KDCo will not be a middleman in any communication and/or dispute between you and the artist.</p>
